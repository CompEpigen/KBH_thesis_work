# "Unused"

Dead-end snakemake pipelines and random files from the project that were ultimately either unused or rolled into other projects

!Beware that most of these directories contain pipelines or scripts that DO NOT WORK and are present purely to keep a record of the work done!

## Description of files:

* meth_calling_pipeline: This directory contains a Snakemake pipeline for doing methylation calling with Nanopore data
* assembly_pipeline: Incomplete pipeline for doing full de novo assembly of Nanopore data
* del_detect: A (broken) Snakemake pipeline for finding reads with a deletion of interest and parsing the accompanying bam and methylation files. Replaced with the better parse_bam.py
