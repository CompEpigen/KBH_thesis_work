# Variant Calling

A directory containing work done to link nanopore-long read using SNVs/SVs

Currently attempting to use [CLAIR](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/Clair)

The ont/ folder contains the model used during CLAIR variant calling, and clair_environment.yaml contains the CLAIR venv config info

A work in progress...
